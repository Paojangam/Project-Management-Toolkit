Alright, let’s cut the fat and make a practical list. You don’t need every bell and whistle Jira and Asana have (unless you want your app to feel like a punishment). Start with the essentials, then expand later.

Must-Have Features (for MVP)

These are the core. Without them, it’s not really a project management tool:

User Accounts (Auth)

Register / Login.

Roles: Admin, Manager, Member.

JWT tokens for secure API access.

Projects

Create / edit / delete projects.

Add description, start date, end date.

Assign members to a project.

Tasks

Create / edit / delete tasks.

Assign tasks to a user.

Task status: To Do, In Progress, Done.

Due date + priority levels.

Tasks visible inside their project.

Task Board (Kanban View)

Columns: To Do, In Progress, Done.

Drag-and-drop tasks between columns.

Quick visual overview of progress.

Comments / Collaboration

Users can comment on tasks.

Show who posted the comment + timestamp.

Dashboard / Overview

List of projects the user is part of.

Summary of assigned tasks + their statuses.

Upcoming deadlines.

Nice-to-Have Features (Phase 2)

Once MVP works, sprinkle some extra magic:

File Uploads

Attach screenshots or docs to tasks.

Notifications

When someone assigns you a task.

When a task is updated or a deadline is near.

Search & Filters

Search tasks by name.

Filter by status, assignee, or priority.

Calendar / Timeline View

See tasks by due date.

Simple Gantt chart for project planning.

Reports / Stats

Tasks completed vs pending.

Project progress % bar.

Real-Time Updates (using Socket.IO)

If someone moves a task to “Done,” everyone sees it instantly without refreshing.

Advanced Features (if you’re feeling bold)

This is “CEO brain” territory — you don’t need them early, but they impress:

@mentions in comments (@username).

Project templates (clone a project setup).

Integrations (Google Drive, Slack, email alerts).

Permissions per project (e.g., view-only members).

Mobile-friendly PWA version.

The Smart Way to Build

Start with Auth + Projects + Tasks (MVP slice).

Add Kanban board + Dashboard for usability.

Layer in Comments for collaboration.

THEN worry about extras like notifications, files, and reports.

So, if I had to give you the “bare minimum to call it a project management tool”, it’s:
Users + Projects + Tasks (with statuses) + Dashboard + Comments.

Do you want me to turn this into a feature roadmap in order of implementation (like Step 1, Step 2, Step 3…), so you know exactly what to build first and what to delay?
